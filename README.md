# Python Assignment: Control Structures

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of control structures in Python, specifically focusing on:

1. **Checking if a Number is Even or Odd** using an `if-else` statement.
2. **Calculating the Sum of Integers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- **Description**: 
  This Python program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd. It uses an `if-else` control structure to perform the check:
    - If the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`), it is classified as "Even".
    - Otherwise, it is classified as "Odd".
  
- **Expected Output**:
  The program prompts the user for input and displays a message indicating whether the number is even or odd. For example:
